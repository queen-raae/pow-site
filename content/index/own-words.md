Are you anxious, angry, or sad? Are you tired, exhausted, or sleepy? Did you bleed one drop, two drops, or three drops?

Do you feel overwhelmed when trying to name things in your cycle? It's often so very detailed and clinical.

Our founder (@raae) has this mood "mollefonk". There is never an option for that. So inevitably, she never remembers if she logged it as anxious, PMS, angry, or...you get the point.

_Wouldn't it be nice to use words and terminology familiar to you?_

**POW!** solves this by letting you hashtag whatever cycle "thing" is important to you. It can be a made-up word like "mollefonk", or a more typical one like "pms".

An entry in **POW!** will look something like this: "First day of #period. Feeling #exhausted, but still kinda #happy."
