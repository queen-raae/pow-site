## Your own words

 <br />

Are you anxious, angry, or sad? Are you tired, exhausted, or sleepy? Did you bleed one drop, two drops, or three drops?

<br />

Do you feel overwhelmed when trying to name things in your cycle? It's often so very detailed and clinical.

<br />

Our founder (@raae) has this mood "mollefonk". There is never an option for that. So inevitably, she never remembers if she logged it as anxious, PMS, angry, or...you get the point.

<br />

_Wouldn't it be nice to use words and terminology familiar to you?_

<br />

**POW!** solves this by letting you hashtag whatever cycle "thing" is important to you. It can be a made-up word like "mollefonk", or a more typical one like "pms".

<br />

An entry in **POW!** will look something like this: "First day of #period. Feeling #exhausted, but still kinda #happy."
