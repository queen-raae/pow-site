## Your personal cycle

 <br />


Am I often exhausted on this day in my cycle? Was it this exact day last cycle I also wanted a divorce? When should I book those sales meetings?

<br />

**Knowledge is power!**

<br />

Our founder (@raae) has learned not to make any drastic changes when she is #mollefonk.

<br />

A founder friend of POW! cannot sell while menstruating, but on the other hand, they are a selling machine when ovulating.

<br />

**POW!** does not make any guesses for you. It lets you know what you have tagged before on the same days of the cycle.

<br />

You might not always be able to plan around your cycle. But knowing that feeling exhausted on cycle day 14 is expected, you can at least skip the added stress of thinking there is a reason and trying to find a solution.
