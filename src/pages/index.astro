			<h2>Your private data</h2>
			<br />
			<p>In February 2018, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-give-apps-sensitive-personal-information-then-they-tell-facebook-11550851636"
			target="_blank"
				>Wall Street Journal</a> came out with a report that popular health apps, period trackers among them, were leaking data to Facebook Analytics.

				More articles followed on the level of surveillance and the implications of these apps:
				<br />
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>
						‚û°Ô∏è It [the app] also shared "reminders" within the app to take birth control medication with Facebook (<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/period-tracker-apps-facebook-maya-mia-fem"
						target="_blank"
						>BuzzFeed</a>
						)
					</li>
					<br />
					<li>
						‚û°Ô∏è These apps then shared user information with the company so it could keep track of how many of its employees were trying to get pregnant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2019/sep/14/your-period-tracking-app-could-be-sharing-intimate-details-with-all-of-facebook"
						target="_blank"
						>The Guardian</a>
						)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				With POW! not even the team can read your data. Your data is locked down using encryption, and only you have the key to open it.

			<h2>Your own words</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Are you anxious, angry, or sad? Are you tired, exhausted, or sleepy? Did you bleed one drop, two drops, or three drops?

				Do you feel overwhelmed when trying to name things in your cycle? It's often so very detailed and clinical.

				Our founder (@raae) has this mood "mollefonk". There is never an option for that. So inevitably, she never remembers if she logged it as anxious, PMS, angry, or...you get the point.

				<br />

				Wouldn't it be nice to use words and terminology familiar to you?

				<br />

				POW! solves this by letting you hashtag whatever cycle "thing" is important to you. It can be a made-up word like "mollefonk", or a more typical one like "pms".

				An entry in POW! will look something like this: "First day of #period. Feeling #exhausted, but still kinda #happy."

			<h2>
				Your personal cycle
			</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				Am I often exhausted on this day in my cycle? Was it this exact day last cycle I also wanted a divorce? When should I book those sales meetings?
			</p>
			<br />
			<h3>Knowledge is power!</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Our founder (@raae) has learned not to make any drastic changes when she is #mollefonk.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				A founder friend of POW! cannot sell while menstruating, but on the other hand, they are a selling machine when ovulating.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				POW! does not make any guesses for you. It lets you know what you have tagged before on the same days of the cycle.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				You might not always be able to plan around your cycle. But knowing that feeling exhausted on cycle day 14 is expected, you can at least skip the added stress of thinking there is a reason and trying to find a solution.
